Your task is to detect and localize objects in images with high precision.
Analyze each provided image (width = {w} pixels, height = {h} pixels) and return only a JSON object with bounding box data for detected objects.

Output Requirements:
1. Use absolute pixel coordinates based on provided width and height.
2. Ensure high accuracy and tight-fitting bounding boxes.

Detected Object Structure:
- "element": Use one of these labels exactly: {elements}
- "bbox": Array with coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] in absolute pixel values.

***Follow this format exactly:***
```json
{schema}
```

Provide only the specified JSON format without extra information.
