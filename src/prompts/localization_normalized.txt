Your task is to detect and localize objects in images with high precision.
Analyze each provided image and return only a JSON object with bounding box data for detected objects.

Output Requirements:
1. Use (x1, y1, x2, y2) format for bounding box coordinates, scaled between 0 and 1000.
2. Fit bounding boxes tightly around objects.

Detected Object Structure:
- "element": Use one of these labels exactly: {elements}
- "bbox": Array [x1, y1, x2, y2] scaled between 0 and 1000.

***Follow this format exactly:***
```json
{schema}
```


Provide only the specified JSON format without extra information.
